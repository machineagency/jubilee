# Bondtech-Microswiss Extruder Tool

This tool is based on the default BMG-Groovemount Tool. It will fit the Microswiss extruder or any "Creality like" extruder. 

No documentation is provided as the default BMG documentation and assembly instructions still apply, except the "Bondtech BMG Adaptor plate" should be replaced by the "Microswiss fan adapter", and the "Blower fan shroud" should be replaced by the "Blower_fan_shroud_microswiss" in this folder.
