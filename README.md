Jubilee V2.2.2
=======

Jubilee is an open-source, extensible multi-tool motion platform capable of running GCode for non-loadbearing automation applications.

![Jubilee](/frame/pics/jubilee_v2.png)

Out-of-the-box, Jubilee is configured for multimaterial 3D printing and multicolor pen plotting, but we've had success with light liquid-handling and image stitching applications too.

While this repository contains all the design-related content needed to build a Jubilee, we suggest using the [**Wiki**](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) to navigate through this "file soup."

## Top-Level Specs
* Automatic Toolchanging compatible with E3D tool plates
* CoreXY Motion System
* 300x300x300 build volume.
* 409mm of horizontal tool rack space
* kinematically coupled bed plate
* autotramming with 3-point bed-leveling
* ~$1350 for a single unit, not including tools. See the [BOM][bom] for the part breakdown
* User Extensible! We encourage extending the design to custom applications via custom tools and bed plates
* Full specs listed on [this wiki page](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Specs)

## Build your own Jubilee

The best way to get started is to thumb through the [**Assembly Instructions**](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Assembly_Instructions) and [**Bill of Materials**][bom] first.

Then head over to the [**Wiki**](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) to start gathering tools and deciding which parts to buy and which parts to make.

### Downloading
There are 3 ways to work with the Jubilee source files: with and without history.
* To download the latest stable release without history, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/releases) page and download the latest release.
* To download the latest stable release with history and track updates, clone the project with the "Code" button above and switch to the corresponding branch.
* To download the latest stable release with history and submit additions back to the main project, create a "Fork" of the project with the button in the upper right. Then switch to the corresponding release branch in your fork of the project.

## Repository Contents
The Repository is broken into three main chunks:
* **frame** contains all design content related to the Jubilee frame
* **tools** contains all design content related to custom tools and tools to help assemble and tune Jubilee
* **software** holds both the Duet config files and profile settings for common slicer packages

inside these folders, you'll usually find a folder structure that looks like this:
* **assembly\_instructions** contains PDFs to take you step-by-step through sub-assemblies of the project.
* **cads** contains raw design files in two formats
    * **Solidworks**
    * **STEP**
* **fabrication\_exports** contains STLs, DXFs, and other files used to fabricate pieces of Jubilee

The Jubilee repository is quite large. To clone the repository locally without fetching the entire history, you can use `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee.git`.
