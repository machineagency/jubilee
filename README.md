Welcome to the Jubilee Project Landing Page

Jubilee is an extensible multi-tool motion platform capable of running GCode for non-loadbearing automation applications.
Out-of-the-box, Jubilee is configured for multimaterial 3D printing and multicolor pen plotting, but we've had success with light liquid-handling and image stitching applications too.
Jubilee is meant to be extended by the community. Have a new tool to add to the repository? Simply check our [contributing]() guidlelines and submit a pull request.

## File Structure

* **CADS** holds variants of the native design files.
* **fabrication_exports** contains files in formats ready for 3D printing, laser cutting, or quoting an external vendor to make for you.
* **software** holds both the Duet config files and profile settings for common slicer packages.
* **assembly_instructions** will take you step-by-step to assembling all the parts in the BOM and fabrication exports to create your own Jubilee

## Quickstart for Multimaterial 3D Printing
1. Budget $1600 for the Frame and $200 per extruder tool.
1. Order all parts in the [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gq5yLxlfPtb3yrGsuXR_ZLhAFGB77CzGvfcWYyYIvT4/edit#gid=0).
1. Print and laser-cut all parts in the *fabrication_exports* folder. (Note that laser-cut parts are now sold as a kit at 713maker.com)
1. 


## Who are we?
Jubilee was designed with love by [Joshua Vasquez](http://www.doublejumpelectric.com/) of the [Machine Agency Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/machines/) at the University of Washington.
